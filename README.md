# Project Description

This mini operating system replicates several classic Windows 7 applications: an image gallery, a notepad, a video player, a web browser, and a calculator.

All applications are built using HTML and CSS, and include a header bar with the classic minimize, maximize, and close buttons, simulating the look of Windows 7 windows.  
The most functional application is the calculator, which can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Its logic is implemented using a separate JavaScript file. Some buttons in the different apps are purely visual (mocked) and do not have any functionality.

The video player includes a sample trailer, the gallery displays several images (mainly memes), and in the notepad you can type freely, although there is no option to save the text.

# 3. Gallery

- HTML file: `app3/galery.html`  
- Description:  
The Image Gallery App is a Windows-7-inspired photo viewer that organizes images in a clean, responsive grid layout. It includes a custom title bar, a functional toolbar with navigation buttons, and an expandable URL bar. Each picture is displayed as a thumbnail with a label, creating a simple and nostalgic interface for browsing and managing images.


# 4. Notepad

- HTML file: `app4/notas.html`  
- Description:  
  This application recreates the classic Windows Notepad. It includes a clean title bar with minimize, maximize, and close buttons, a simple menu bar, and a large text area where you can type freely, just like in the original Notepad.  
  The interface imitates the minimalist Windows style: soft borders, light colors, and a small status bar at the bottom showing information such as line, column, encoding, and zoom level.  
  It is designed for quick note-taking, with no distractions or extra features—just typing. The whole interface is built with HTML and CSS.


# 5. Video Player (VLC)

- HTML file: `app5/video.html`  
- Description:  
  This application recreates the classic VLC Media Player interface from Windows 7, including the title bar, top menu, media controls, and Aero-style visuals.  
  It uses HTML, CSS, and `<video>` / `<audio>` elements to simulate the original look and feel, with gradients, glossy buttons, shadows, and custom-styled media controls.  
  The app plays video and audio on loop, includes a custom progress bar, and works as a functional mock-up that imitates the design of the VLC player on Windows 7.
